Farm-to-Fork-Fruit-Monitoring-and-Verification-Using-Blockchain

A secure traceability system that tracks fruit data from harvesting to consumption using Python, FastAPI, and blockchain for tamper-proof records.

This project offers a transparent and immutable solution to monitor the entire lifecycle of fruitsâ€”from harvesting to delivery. Developed with Python (FastAPI) and blockchain technology, it ensures data integrity by recording every stage of the fruitâ€™s journey, including harvesting, storage, and transportation, on a tamper-resistant ledger. The user-friendly web interface enables users to add new fruit data, view its history, and explore the blockchain, helping farmers, distributors, and consumers verify authenticity, enhance trust, and reduce fraud in the food supply chain.
